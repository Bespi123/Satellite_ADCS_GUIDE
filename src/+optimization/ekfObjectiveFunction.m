    % ekfObjectiveFunction - Evaluates the cost of a set of EKF parameters using a
    %                        Monte Carlo approach to handle stochastic noise.
    %
    % This function is intended to be called by optimize_ekf_ga.m
    % to determine the quality of a given set of EKF noise covariance
    % parameters. It runs multiple simulations to get a stable, averaged cost.
    %
    % Inputs:
    %   params        - Row vector containing the EKF parameters to be optimized.
    %   disturbances  - Structure with external disturbances for the simulation.
    %   simParameters - Structure with the base simulation parameters.
    %   time          - Structure with simulation time parameters.
    %
    % Output:
    %   costs_vector  - A row vector containing the final, averaged Root Mean
    %                   Square Error (RMSE) for each state. A lower value is better.

    % vector, you must adjust 'num_states' to match its length.
    num_states = 1;
    total_costs_matrix = zeros(num_simulations, num_states);

    % --- 1. Extract Parameters from Optimizer ---
    % The 'params' vector from the optimizer is used to update the EKF's
    % noise standard deviations for this evaluation.

    % --- 3. Calculate Final Averaged Cost ---
    % Average the costs from all simulation runs to get a stable metric.
    % The mean is taken along the first dimension (down the rows).
    avg_costs_per_state = mean(total_costs_matrix, 1);
